**write a quick description of why tailwind sucks**

tailwind is a css framework that is supposed to make it easier to write css
it does this by giving you a bunch of classes that you can use to style your html
the problem is that it is a css framework that is supposed to make it easier to write css
yes, thats right, its just more css
your still writing css, just in a space that should be reserved for writing logic and defining layouts
not to mention that the classes are not very intuitive, and the documentation is not very good (i mean i think so)
on a seperate note, i feel like i should mention that i am not a fan of css frameworks in general
i think that css frameworks are a bad idea, and that they should be avoided at all costs

i dont know why i wrote this, i just felt like it was a good idea at the time
and gpt 3 did a good job of writing it
